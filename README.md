# Simple todo app

## Learning Goals
I built this todo app to familiarize myself with react concepts such as hooks including:
* Redux: to manage my todos state
* useState: to manage state locally within my component.
  
## Features
As user:
* You can create a todo
* Update a todo based on category and description
* Filter todos
* Delete a todo
* Search for a todo
